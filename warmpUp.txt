my ideal  job after completing the codeUp bootcamp, would align with a field that is going to provide a challenge and consistent work, whether that is self-employed or through an employer. ideally pay wise i would like to be in the range of upper 70s but at a minimum i would accept 55s. as for the company, I have no preference in company and would be looking for a position that is either hybrid or remote work to balance the home/work life better.
