<h1>Warm Ups</h1>
<p>Smart Goals</p>
<p>my ideal job after completing the codeUp bootcamp, would align with a field that is going to provide a challenge and
    consistent work, whether that is self-employed or through an employer. ideally pay wise i would like to be in the
    range of upper 70s but at a minimum i would accept 55s. as for the company, I have no preference in company and
    would be looking for a position that is either hybrid or remote work to balance the home/work life better.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Specific: After completing the CodeUp bootcamp, I aim to secure a software development role that challenges me
        and aligns with my newly acquired skills.
    </li>
    <li>Measurable: I will track my progress by applying to at least 10 relevant job positions per week.</li>
    <li>Achievable: I will work on building a portfolio of projects during and after the bootcamp to enhance my
        qualifications.
    </li>
    <li>Relevant: This goal aligns with my passion for coding and desire for consistent work-life balance.</li>
    <li>Time-bound: I will achieve this goal within 6 months after completing the bootcamp.</li>
</ul>
